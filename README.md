# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network

In this programming homework, I implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and used it to classify hand-written digits. (This was a deliverable for CS561 at USC. The homework description pdf can be found in the repository)

#### Dataset:
It used the MNIST dataset (​http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/​). (Formatting instructions are mentioned in the homework pdf)

#### Model:
Input Layer: 784 input nodes.  
Hidden Layer: 397 nodes with Sigmoid Activation.  
Output Layer: 10 output nodes with Softmax Activation.

#### Accuracy:
98%
